    <p>"Gentle Giant"</p>
    <P>Just over one years old and is already taller than his older sister Loki, Thor is biggest cat in the house. Despite his big frame he is the most laid back and will just often sit next to you, sometimes will even sleep next to you if the conditions are right.</P> 
    <p>Thor doesn't quite now how to meow properly. He just squeaks.</P>
