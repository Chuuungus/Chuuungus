            <p>"The Queen complex".</p> 
             <p>The oldest of the five. Despite having a superiority complex, Spartacus is a big coward and often runs away from conflict with her siblings whenever possible.</p>
             <p>Spartacus is very intelligent, she is very good with rembering and performing tricks. She is the best "purrformer" for tricks. </p>
            <p>She will constantly remind you that she is your queen and thinks you should treat her as one. She does this by showing up out of nowhere whenever you have delicious human food and will beg for food like she has not eaten in weeks.</p> 
            <p>She is the fluffiest out of the five. She will be your best friend for life if you give her a chicken nugget. </p>
