            <p>"Hungry Chunk"</p>

            <p>The second oldest and ex-stray. Out of the five, she is the only one with real experience surviving in the wild.</p>
            <p>After landing a more comfortable life, she has developed a more laid-back approach in life and now entered the circular dimension. She has now become "CHUNKY" as the internet would describe it.</p>
            <p>You can easily tell the difference between Loki and the other cats, because she is the only one with a chipped ear. She is the Mum of the group and can only be motivated with food. Er she is the widest out of the five... </p>
