                <p>"Mr. Tiny little brain cell/ Captain Stinky/ Toilet sentinel"</p>
                
                <p>Diluc does not understand the concept of caution or danger. Which explains why he keeps running into doors or walls and falling from high heights every now and then.</p> 
                <p>He also does not understand the concept of personal space. He loves annoying his older sister Spartacus into playing with her. Even though she just wants her personal space.</p>
                <p>For some bizarre reason, Diluc likes accompanying you in the toilet, ensuring you have a safe 1 or 2. 

                    To tell the difference between him and his siblings is very difficult, especially between Spartacus and Kaeya.</p>
                    <p> However, if you look closer, he will always have a confused look on his face. Also, he is the tallest in the tuxedo bunch.
                    
                    If you play with him and keep him entertained consistently. He will love you forever.</p>
